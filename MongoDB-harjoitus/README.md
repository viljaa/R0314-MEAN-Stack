# Mongo DB exercise with node.js

In this exercise I created a web interface for adding data into Mongo Database in the form of registering users into database and then allowing them to "log in" with the created credentials.<br><br>
Web interface was created using node.js with Mongo DB in the back end and EJS, Pure.css and own css styles in the front end.<br>
